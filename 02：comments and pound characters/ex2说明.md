# EX2: Comments and Pound Characters

* ### 例子：

  ```python
  # A comment, this is so you can read your program laterself.
  # Angthing after the # is ignored by python.
  print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored
  # You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
  # print("This won't work")
  
  print("This will run.")
  ```
  
* ### 学习内容：`print()`；`#`；

  * 在“EX1：A Good First Program”中已有解释

* ### 深入练习（Study Drills）

  * 无特别问题

* ### 改变代码（寻找可能情况及错误）

  * #### `#`放入字符串中

    输入：

    ```python
    print("I could have # code like this.")
    ```

    结果：

    ```powershell
    PS F:\python\hard way 练习> python ex2.py
    I could have # code like this.
    ```

    不出错，因为此时`#`被认为是字符串
